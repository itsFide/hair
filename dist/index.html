                                I've been struggling with hair loss for a long time, but thanks to HairWell DHT Blocker,
                                my
                                problem is solved! My hair started growing faster, and the shedding has significantly
                                reduced. I'm extremely satisfied with the results!

                                I can't believe how HairWell DHT Blocker has made my hair thicker and stronger!
                                Additionally, I've noticed a significant improvement in the condition of my scalp.
                                Highly recommended.

                                HairWell DHT Blocker has given me confidence in my hair! Previously, they were shedding
                                and looking dull, but now they're full of life and health. Very satisfied with the
                                results.

                </p> -->
          <h3>ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</h3>
          <p>You and EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER agree that this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a
            transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act
            ("FAA"), and not by any state law concerning arbitration; and that any dispute between us
            relating to our web site, the services provided through our web site, any transaction or
            relationship between us resulting from your use of our web site, communications between us, or
            the purchase, order, or use of EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER services and/or products, including
            disputes by either of us against any agent, employee, subsidiary, affiliate, predecessor in
            interest, successor, or assign of the other, will be resolved exclusively and finally by binding
            arbitration, except for disputes arising from an alleged violation of intellectual property
            rights or breach of confidentiality, for which the injured party may suffer irreparable harm and
            may seek a restraining order, preliminary injunctive relief, an injunction, specific performance
            or other equitable relief and/or legal remedies, and actions to enforce the decisions of the
            arbitrators, for which action may be taken in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and
            EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER further agree that any determination regarding the applicability,
            enforceability, or validity of this arbitration agreement will be made by the arbitrator, not by
            any court.</p>
          <h3>BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT,
            INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.</h3>
          <p>In arbitration, a dispute is resolved by a neutral arbitrator or panel of arbitrators, rather
            than by a judge or jury. Arbitration is more informal, however, an arbitrator can award the same
            relief that a court can award. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration
            Association ("AAA"), and conducted under AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules and the
            Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the "AAA Rules") then in
            effect at the time of the dispute.</p>
          <h3>YOU MAY OBTAIN COPIES OF THE AAA RULES AND FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR INITIATING ARBITRATION BY
            VISITING THE AAA WEBSITE AT WWW.ADR.ORG, OR BY CALLING AAA AT (800) 788-7879.</h3>
          <p>If for any reason the AAA is unavailable, the parties shall mutually select another arbitration
            forum. If you initiate arbitration, EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER will promptly reimburse you for
            any standard filing fee which may have been required under AAA's Procedures once you have
            notified EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER in writing and provided a copy of the arbitration
            proceedings. However, if EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER is the prevailing party in the arbitration,
            applicable law may allow the arbitrator to award attorneys' fees and costs to EcoWise ADVANCED
            FAT BURNER, including the filing fee.</p>
          <h3>CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h3>
          <p>There shall be no right or authority for any claim to be arbitrated on a class action basis or in
            a purported representative capacity. No claim submitted to arbitration is heard by a jury or may
            be brought as a private attorney general. You do not have the right to act as a class
            representative or participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any claim
            submitted to arbitration. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims
            against EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER and may not preside over any kind of representative or class
            proceeding against EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER. You acknowledge that this class action waiver is
            material and essential to the arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is
            nonseverable from the agreement to arbitrate claims. If any portion of this class action waiver
            is limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate shall be
            null and void.</p>
          <h3>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST
            EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN
            ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. IF YOU HAVE ALREADY PURCHASED A PRODUCT
            AND YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE FOREGOING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MUST TELL US IN WRITING AND
            RETURN THE PRODUCT TO GET A REFUND, NOT USE THE PRODUCT OR WEB SITE, AND RETURN THE PRODUCT FOR
            A REFUND WITHIN 30 DAYS OF YOUR FIRST ORDER OF THE PRODUCT.</h3>
          <h3>TRIAL OFFER</h3>

          <h3>PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
          <p>Welcome to the EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER website (ecowise-afb.com or the "Website"). This
            written policy (the "Privacy Policy") is designed to tell you about our practices regarding

            related services. Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before using, or submitting
            information, to this Website.</p>
          <h3>POLICY</h3>
          <p>The policy of the Website is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. To fulfill this
            policy, the Website agrees to exercise the precautions set forth in this Privacy Policy to
            maintain the confidentiality of information provided by you in connection with accessing and
            using the Website.</p>
          <h3>YOUR CONSENT</h3>

            consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of that information in accordance with this
            Privacy Policy.</p>
          <h3>OUR COMMITMENT TO CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h3>
          <p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. This Website is not intended
            for people under the age of 18. We never collect or maintain information at the Website from
            persons we know to be under age 18, and no part of our Website is designed to attract anyone
            under age 18. We encourage parents to talk to their children about their use of the Internet and
            the information they disclose to websites.</p>
          <h3>ACTIVE INFORMATION COLLECTION</h3>
          <p>Like many websites, this Website actively collects information from its visitors both by asking
            you specific questions and by permitting you to communicate directly with us via e-mail and/or
            feedback forms. Some of the information that you submit may be personally identifiable
            information (that is, information that can be uniquely identified with you, such as your full
            name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number and sales delivery, billing and credit card
            information).</p>
          <p>Some areas of this Website may require you to submit information in order for you to benefit from
            the specified features (such as newsletter subscriptions, tips/pointers, order processing) or to
            participate in a particular activity (such as other promotions). You will be informed at each
            information collection point what information is required and what information is optional.</p>
          <h3>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h3>
          <p>Except as otherwise stated, we may use your information to improve the content of our Website,
            customize the Website to your preferences, communicate information to you (if you have requested
            it), for our marketing and research purposes, and for the purposes specified in this Privacy
            Policy. If you provide personally identifiable information to this Website, we may combine such
            information with other actively collected information unless we specify otherwise at the point
            of collection. We may combine your personally identifiable information with passively collected
            information. We may disclose your personally identifiable information to other affiliates
            worldwide that agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In addition, we may
            disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties, located in the United States
            and/or any other country, but only:</p>
          <p>to contractors we use to support our business (e.g., fulfillment services, technical support,
            delivery services, and financial institutions), in which case we will require such third parties
            to agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy; in connection with the sale,
            assignment, or other transfer of the business of this site to which the information relates, in
            which case we will require any such buyer to agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy
            Policy; or where required by applicable laws, court orders, or government regulations. In
            addition, we will make full use of all information acquired through this site that is not in
            personally identifiable form.</p>
          <p>Remember that the information provided by this site is for general background purposes and is not
            intended to be used in connection with, or as a substitute for, medical diagnosis or treatment
            by a trained professional. You should always consult your own physician about any healthcare
            questions you may have, especially before trying a new medication, diet, fitness program, or
            approach to health care issues.</p>
          <h3>OPT-OUT PROCEDURES</h3>
          <p>You may always opt-out of receiving communications from us. To not receive future e-mail
            communications from EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER, please go to ecowise-afb.com or contact us at
            care@ecowise-afb.com, 5am to 8pm PST Monday to Sunday</p>
          <h3>SECURITY OF INFORMATION</h3>
          <p>You can be assured that personal information collected through the Website is secure and is
            maintained in a manner consistent with current industry standards. The importance of security
            for all personal information associated with our subscribers is of utmost concern to us. Your
            personal information is protected in several ways. Your personal information resides on a secure
            server that only selected EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER employees and contractors have access to
            via password. In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and order
            fulfillment are handled by established third-party banking, processing agents and distribution
            institutions. They receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or
            other payment information and to process and ship your order.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed
            to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, you
            acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the internet which are
            beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data
            exchanged between you and us through this Website cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such
            information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party. Moreover, where
            you use passwords, ID numbers, or other special access features on this Website, it is your
            responsibility to safeguard them.</p>
          <h3>PASSIVE INFORMATION COLLECTION</h3>
          <p>As you navigate through a website, certain information can be passively collected (that is,
            gathered without you actively providing the information) using various technologies and means,
            such as Internet Protocol addresses, cookies, Internet tags, and navigational data collection.
          </p>
          <p>This Website may use Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP Address is a number assigned to your
            computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet and is generally
            considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is
            dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a
            particular user's computer). We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our server, report
            aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to our
            Website, and administer and improve services to our consumers.</p>
          <p>A "cookie" is a bit of information that a website sends to your web browser that helps the site
            remember information about you and your preferences.</p>
          <p>"Session cookies" are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your web
            browser window or otherwise turn your computer off. Session cookies are used to improve
            navigation on websites and to collect aggregate statistical information. This Website uses
            session cookies.</p>
          <p>"Persistent cookies" are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of
            your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store information
            on your computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have
            previously provided (e.g., username), helping to determine what areas of the website visitors
            find most valuable, and customizing the website based on your preferences. This Website uses
            persistent cookies.</p>
          <p>"Internet tags" (also known as single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs)
            are smaller than cookies and tell the website server information such as the IP address and
            browser type related to the visitor's computer. This Website uses Internet tags. "Navigational
            data" ("log files," "server logs," and "clickstream" data) and "Internet Tags" are used for
            system management, to improve the content of the site, market research purposes, and to
            communicate information to visitors. This Website uses navigational data.</p>
          <h3>LINKS</h3>
          <p>This Website may contain links to websites of third parties not affiliated with EcoWise ADVANCED
            FAT BURNER. This Privacy Policy will not apply to these third-party websites and the Website is
            not responsible for the privacy practices or the content on any of these other websites, even
            where these third-party sites indicate a special relationship or "partnership" with the Website.
            We do not disclose personally identifiable information to those responsible for the linked
            sites. The linked sites, however, may collect personal information from you when you link to
            their site. This collecting of information is not subject to the control of the Website. To
            ensure protection of your privacy, always review the privacy policies of the sites you visit by
            linking from this Website.</p>

            purposes, disclosed to third parties, or used by us or third parties to send promotional
            correspondence to you. We may also use personal information for auditing, research and analysis
            to operate and improve our technologies and services. We may share aggregated and non personal
            information with third parties. When we use third parties to assist us in processing your
            personal information, we require that they comply with our Privacy Policy and any other
            appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We may also share information with third
            parties in limited circumstances, including when complying with legal process, preventing fraud
            or imminent harm, and ensuring the security of our network and services. You may remove your
            information from our database. If you remove your information from our database it will no
            longer be used by us for secondary purposes, disclosed to third parties, or used by us or third
            parties to send promotional correspondence to you. You may remove your information by sending
            your request in writing via email to care@ecowise-afb.com or by sending "STOP", "END",

            associated with your account whenever we make any substantive changes to this Privacy Policy. If
            you do not accept the changed version (for example, if you do not approve of a different way
            that we intend to use personal information) you may let us know by letter or e-mail. If you do
            not respond with any objections, we will assume that you consent to changes in the Privacy
            Policy. Changes will not apply retroactively to personal information that was collected before
            the changes to the Privacy Policy, except as may be required by law.</p>
