                    <h3>ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</h3>
                    <p>You and EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER agree that this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a
                        transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act
                        ("FAA"), and not by any state law concerning arbitration; and that any dispute between us
                        relating to our web site, the services provided through our web site, any transaction or
                        relationship between us resulting from your use of our web site, communications between us, or
                        the purchase, order, or use of EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER services and/or products, including
                        disputes by either of us against any agent, employee, subsidiary, affiliate, predecessor in
                        interest, successor, or assign of the other, will be resolved exclusively and finally by binding
                        arbitration, except for disputes arising from an alleged violation of intellectual property
                        rights or breach of confidentiality, for which the injured party may suffer irreparable harm and
                        may seek a restraining order, preliminary injunctive relief, an injunction, specific performance
                        or other equitable relief and/or legal remedies, and actions to enforce the decisions of the
                        arbitrators, for which action may be taken in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and
                        EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER further agree that any determination regarding the applicability,
                        enforceability, or validity of this arbitration agreement will be made by the arbitrator, not by
                        any court.</p>
                    <h3>BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT,
                        INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.</h3>
                    <p>In arbitration, a dispute is resolved by a neutral arbitrator or panel of arbitrators, rather
                        than by a judge or jury. Arbitration is more informal, however, an arbitrator can award the same
                        relief that a court can award. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration
                        Association ("AAA"), and conducted under AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules and the
                        Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the "AAA Rules") then in
                        effect at the time of the dispute.</p>
                    <h3>YOU MAY OBTAIN COPIES OF THE AAA RULES AND FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR INITIATING ARBITRATION BY
                        VISITING THE AAA WEBSITE AT WWW.ADR.ORG, OR BY CALLING AAA AT (800) 788-7879.</h3>
                    <p>If for any reason the AAA is unavailable, the parties shall mutually select another arbitration
                        forum. If you initiate arbitration, EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER will promptly reimburse you for
                        any standard filing fee which may have been required under AAA's Procedures once you have
                        notified EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER in writing and provided a copy of the arbitration
                        proceedings. However, if EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER is the prevailing party in the arbitration,
                        applicable law may allow the arbitrator to award attorneys' fees and costs to EcoWise ADVANCED
                        FAT BURNER, including the filing fee.</p>
                    <h3>CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h3>
                    <p>There shall be no right or authority for any claim to be arbitrated on a class action basis or in
                        a purported representative capacity. No claim submitted to arbitration is heard by a jury or may
                        be brought as a private attorney general. You do not have the right to act as a class
                        representative or participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any claim
                        submitted to arbitration. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims
                        against EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER and may not preside over any kind of representative or class
                        proceeding against EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER. You acknowledge that this class action waiver is
                        material and essential to the arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is
                        nonseverable from the agreement to arbitrate claims. If any portion of this class action waiver
                        is limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate shall be
                        null and void.</p>
                    <h3>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST
                        EcoWise ADVANCED FAT BURNER IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN
                        ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. IF YOU HAVE ALREADY PURCHASED A PRODUCT
                        AND YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE FOREGOING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MUST TELL US IN WRITING AND
                        RETURN THE PRODUCT TO GET A REFUND, NOT USE THE PRODUCT OR WEB SITE, AND RETURN THE PRODUCT FOR
                        A REFUND WITHIN 30 DAYS OF YOUR FIRST ORDER OF THE PRODUCT.</h3>
                    <h3>TRIAL OFFER</h3>
                    <p>The 14 day day trial offer for Product includes enrollment in our recurring shipping program,
                        which is subject to the terms described below.</p>
                    <p>You must contact customer service at least one (1) business day before the end of the 14 day day
                        trial period to cancel and make arrangements to return the trial supply to avoid paying for the
                        trial supply and continuing in our recurring shipping program. See customer service contact
                        information below. If you do not contact customer service to cancel at least one (1) business
                        day before the end of the 14 day day trial period, we will charge $124.97, which includes
                        shipping and handling, the day after the trial period ends to the card you provided at checkout
                        and you will continue with the recurring shipping program. Approximately every thirty (30) days
                        after the trial period ("Subscription Term"), we will automatically charge $124.97, to the same
                        card you provided when you signed up for the trial offer. Please note that we calculate the 14
                        day day trial period and Subscription Term in calendar days (Monday thru Sunday), not business
                        days.</p>
                    <h3>RECURRING SHIPPING PROGRAM</h3>
                    <p>Unless you cancel at least one (1) business day before the end of the trial period or
                        Subscription Term, our recurring shipping program will ship you a fresh thirty (30) day supply
                        of the Product two (2) days after you place your trial order and approximately every thirty (30)
                        days thereafter. You may cancel your enrollment in the recurring shipping program at least one
                        (1) business day before the expiration of the trial period or Subscription Term by contacting
                        customer service. See customer service contact information below.</p>
                    <h3>RETURN AND REFUND POLICY</h3>
                    <p>Before End of Trial Period</p>
                    <p>To cancel your account and void the $7.95 charge for the trial supply, you must contact customer
                        service at care@ecowise-afb.com and obtain instructions to return your trial supply at least one

                        business day before the end of the 14 day day trial period. Our customer service will issue you
                        a Return Merchandise Authorization ("RMA") number. You must write the RMA number clearly on the
                        outside of your return package and send the return shipment to the address provided by our
                        customer service agent.</p>
                    <p>You are responsible for paying all costs related to shipping the trial supply back to us using

                    <p>Your return package must be received by us within 10 days after you receive the RMA number. If we
                        do not receive your return package within that time period, you will be charged $124.97 for the
                        cost of the Product, but you will be canceled from our recurring shipping program.</p>
                    <p>Please note that we do not accept or process packages marked "Return to Sender" or that do not
                        otherwise have the RMA number marked clearly on it.</p>

                        considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is
                        dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a
                        particular user's computer). We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our server, report
                        aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to our
                        Website, and administer and improve services to our consumers.</p>

                    <p>"Session cookies" are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your web

                        on your computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have
                        previously provided (e.g., username), helping to determine what areas of the website visitors
                        find most valuable, and customizing the website based on your preferences. This Website uses
